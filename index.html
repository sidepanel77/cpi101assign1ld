		My name is Lucas, and I am a sophomore here at ASU, majoring in Informatics.
		I like to play video games, and I even stream them on Twitch, usually playing Minecraft
		or Tetris on there (<a href="https://twitch.tv/sidepanel/">link for the interested</a>).
		I don't know what else to say about me, I'm not too terribly interesting.<br><br>

		Here is my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>, without my address and phone number, of course.
